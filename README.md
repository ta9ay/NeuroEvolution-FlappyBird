# NeuroEvolution-FlappyBird
## Using Neuroevolution to play FlappyBird.

Using my own [NeuralNetwork code](https://github.com/ta9ay/NeuralNet-from-scratch "NeuralNet-from_scratch") to write a NeuroEvolutionary algorithm to play [FlappyBird](https://github.com/jmathison/Flappython)
#### Possible Improvements:
1. The scoring mechanism to record each bird's score might be improved.
2. Saving the best bird and then having the option to load that bird.

### Requirements
1. PyGame
2. NumPy
